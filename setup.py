    # This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
